## **By Brady Klockenga**

## **Description**

##### This is a language suggester survey tool created to help others struggling to pick a language to start off with one. This project will ask the user 5 questions via a form, process that info and submit that info instantly to give the user a suggested language to start with. There are 3 languages used for results of the survey those being: C#, JavaScript, and Ruby. Some humor was added to keep the survey light and this is strictly intended to be used merely as an suggestion and no way am I or Epicodus responsible for any path the user chooses to take.
